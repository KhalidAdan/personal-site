### The problem

Let me know if you've encountered this problem before.

You are onboarding into a new job, at a new company. You're working on a project, and you need to add a new feature. You're pretty sure you know how to implement it, but the onboarding documents don't have the specific credentials you're looking for, and even if they mention the app you're stuck.

You ping your onboarding buddy, project manager or a team mate. They're busy, and don't get back to you for a few hours. You're stuck, and can't make progress. You email them again, and they get back to you. You're able to make progress, but once the solution is complete, the testing and deployment process is a black box and CI is failing on something you didn't touch.

The next say at stand-up you mention the issue, and the team lead says "Oh yeah, that's a known issue. We're working on it. in the mean time, you can do X, Y, Z to get around it".

### Why not just write this down?
