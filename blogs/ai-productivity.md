In a time where technology is shaping our lives more than ever, I can honestly say that artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly streamlined my work, personal life, and even my hobbies. Whether itâ€™s crafting the perfect email, churning out the first drafts of complex software solutions, or assisting me in building a customized hitbox for a fighting game, AI has proven itself to be an invaluable asset.

A prime example of this is email writing. We've all been there - struggling to find the right words, maintaining the balance between professional and personal tones. I've found that by using AI to translate my bullet-point thoughts into coherent messages, I've been able to create impactful emails, often without requiring more than a few tweaks.

In the realm of software solutions, I've found that AI can be a fantastic starting point. By providing the problem I'm trying to solve, AI helps me construct the first draft of the solution. There's still room for improvement, as AI can sometimes "hallucinate," or produce non-ideal outputs. However, even if the code is only 50-60% correct, I'm still given a base to work from and refine.
