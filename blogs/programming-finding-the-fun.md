There is a certain level of mystique that envelopes the field of programming. When you _really look at it,_ it almost feels like wizardry. An act of creating something out of nothing, by merely sending a string of text commands to an object of plastic and rock that has been convinced to think for us. Absolutely bonkers.

### Why programming is magic

Let's take a moment to ponder over this: as programmers we are tasked with thorouglhy understanding a problem, and then instruct our computer, to solve it for us. These instructions are nothing more than a clear set of commands. It's as if we've embedded a part of our consciousness into the machine, enabling it to execute our thoughts and reach a solution.

This process of programming comes closest to the concept of telepathy, the supposed communication of thoughts or ideas by means other than the known senses. We take a thought, a solution, translate it into a language that the computer understands, and voila, our thought is now a reality. The definition of telepathy is:

> the supposed communication of thoughts or ideas by means other than the known senses.

You may say, 'Khalid, you are translating your thoughts by touch, and therefore it is not telepathy'. Okay, true but no need to be a nerd about it. This unique ability to create, to solve, and to manifest our thoughts into tangible outcomes really blows me away every time I think about it.

### Programming is a craft

Programming isn't just some mystical art - it's also a skill that calls for a lot of discipline, attention to detail, and a dash of creativity. Every single part of your solution could be the one thing that trips you up, so you've got to think it through thoroughly. The real challenge? You need to break down your thoughts about the problem so they make sense to your computer. Then, you've got to convert that into a language your computer speaks: code.

It's like walking a tightrope, balancing analytical thinking and creative flair. The goal? Crafting code that doesn't just solve your problem, but does it smoothly and elegantly. This blend of rigor and finesse in programming is what really makes it stand out.

### Losing the spark

Just like any craft, there might be moments when your initial enthusiasm begins to wane. These can be times when coding feels a bit dull, the problems appear insurmountable, or the thrill of creating seems to diminish. You might even feel like the initial magic of programming is fading and the task is becoming more of a chore. It's perfectly okay to feel this way and entirely normal.

You might find that changing your project or taking a complete break from coding could help. It's crucial to remember that these feelings are a natural part of the journey, it's okay to experience them, and they are temporary. Your passion will reignite.

When you decide to pause, truly allow yourself the downtime. The aim here is to refresh yourself. If something catches your attention, that's okay, but remember to focus on relaxing. Avoid pressuring yourself to code and don't let guilt creep in for not coding.

During my own breaks, the most interaction I have with coding is jotting down ideas or things I want to try on my phone. But I steer clear of actual coding. This approach allows me to maintain a healthy balance, helping keep the coding experience enjoyable and sustainable.

### Finding the fun

So, you're wondering how to make programming fun? It's simple. Start with a project that sparks your interest. Ideally, it should be something you're dealing with in your own life â€“ that way, you're motivated to find a solution.

Take my current side project, Pulse, as an example. I've recently gotten into hardware hacking and have a couple of handheld emulators to play some of my old GBA library. The issue I ran into is: sharing save files between my PC and all of these different android handhelds. It's something I'm personally invested in, which makes the work feel more like play.

And don't sweat it if you find yourself wanting to drop a project. It doesn't mean you've failed. Life gets in the way sometimes, and it's okay to step back and take a breather. You might even find that starting from scratch helps you see things from a different angle. One of my buddies is a prime example of this. They're into compilers and have written a whole bunch of them while learning the ropes. Every new iteration brings them new insights and skills. It's a great way to learn and grow.
