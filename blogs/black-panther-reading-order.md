Happy Canada Day!

This is a departure from my usual posts, but I wanted to share a reading order I put together for the Black Panther series by Ta-Nehisi Coates. I've been re-reading the series, and I've been enjoying it a lot. I've also been gushing about it to anyone who will listen for the past few years (as well as Hudlin's run), so I figured I'd put together a reading order for anyone who wants to get into it. If I've been given this link, I hope you enjoy the series as much as I have!

Note: This is not a definitive reading order, with all of Coates work as the main author or co-author. This leaves out some of the spin-off series, like World of Wakanda, and some of the one-off issues, like the Black Panther Annuals (though they are pretty cool!) and things like Rise of the Black Panther and any Deadpool shenanigans. This is just the main series, with the main story arc, as I see it.

## Black Panther (2016) A Nation Under Our Feet Vol. 1

Collects Black Panther (2016) #1-4, Fantastic Four #52.

The first arc of Ta-Nehisi Coates' run on Black Panther, this is where it all starts. It explores T'Challa's rule and the political unrest in Wakanda. Beautifully illustrated by Brian Stelfreeze, this story sets up the complex world that the following arcs build upon. Stelfreeze's art is insanely good and the story is less of the trope-y afro-superhero stuff and more of a political drama. It's a great start to the series.

You can skip Fantastic Four #52 if you like here!

## Black Panther (2016) A Nation Under Our Feet Vol. 2

Collects Black Panther (2016) #5-8, Jungle Action #6-7.

## A New Chapter

Starting this past June, T'Challa returned to Earth with a new run helmed by Eve.L. Ewing. Here is the preview Marvel is giving us for the new series:

> After a difficult war with the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda, King T'Challa returned home to find Wakanda—and his place in it—greatly changed in his absence. A king is called to make tough decisions, but T'Challa's choices in the wake of this change saw him ousted from the Avengers and exiled from Wakanda.

You're all caught up (as of today) and can start reading the new series! Have fun!
